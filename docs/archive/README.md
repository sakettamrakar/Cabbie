# Legacy Documentation Archive

This folder contains historical documentation preserved for reference. The content may be outdated and is superseded by the canonical guides in the parent `docs/` directory.

Use the current documentation set before consulting these files:

- [docs/README.md](../README.md)
- [docs/SETUP.md](../SETUP.md)
- [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [docs/API.md](../API.md)
- [docs/DATABASE.md](../DATABASE.md)
- [docs/STYLEGUIDE.md](../STYLEGUIDE.md)
- [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](../TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

If you migrate useful content from the archive, update the modern docs and remove the duplicate to keep this folder minimal.
