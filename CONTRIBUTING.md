# Contributing Guide

Welcome to Cabbie! This guide outlines how to propose changes, run checks, and collaborate effectively with maintainers and AI coding assistants.

## 1. Ground Rules

- Target Node 20.x and npm 10.x.
- Do not commit secrets or `.env` files.
- Avoid modifying production data directly; use migrations + seeds.
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes (see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)).

## 2. Branch & Commit Strategy

| Item | Convention |
| --- | --- |
| Branch naming | `feature/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`, or `docs/<slug>` (lowercase, hyphenated). |
| Commit style | Use conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`). |
| Pull request checklist | Describe changes, link to relevant docs/tests, include screenshots for UI updates. |

Avoid force-pushing to shared branches. If you need to rework a PR, add incremental commits and squash on merge.

## 3. Development Workflow

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Sync Prisma client & DB: `npm run prisma:generate`, `npm run db:migrate`, `npm run db:seed`.
4. Start dev server: `npm run dev`.
5. Make changes in TypeScript files (`.ts`, `.tsx`) unless you are editing legacy `.js` modules intentionally.

## 4. Testing & Quality Gates

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run test` | Jest unit/integration tests. |
| `npm run test:pw` | Playwright E2E tests (requires dev server on :3000). |
| `npm run axe:contrast` / `npm run test:a11y:axe` | Accessibility regression checks. |
| `npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx` | Lint TypeScript/React source (run manually before PR). |
| `npm run check:budgets` | Performance budget verification. |

All commands must pass before maintainers review a PR. Document any intentionally skipped checks in the PR description.

## 5. Database Changes

- Update `prisma/schema.prisma` and run `npm run db:migrate -- --name <migration-name>`.
- Commit migration files under `prisma/migrations/`.
- Update `prisma/seed.js` if new tables or columns require seed data.
- Document the change in [docs/DATABASE.md](docs/DATABASE.md) and mention in the PR.

## 6. Documentation Expectations

- Update README or relevant docs when behavior changes.
- Add new entries to [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for any new documentation file.
- Keep API contract updates synchronized with [docs/API.md](docs/API.md).
- For UI changes, note accessibility considerations in the PR (keyboard access, ARIA attributes, contrast results).

## 7. Code Style & Patterns

- Prefer functional React components with hooks.
- Use TypeScript types/interfaces for props and function signatures.
- Reuse helpers from `lib/` (e.g., `lib/validate.ts`, `lib/errors.ts`) rather than duplicating logic.
- Favor async/await with proper error handling via `withApi` and `makeError`.
- Log sparingly; production logs should remain clean.

## 8. Review Process

1. Open a PR against the `main` branch.
2. Fill in the PR template (summary, testing evidence, screenshots if applicable).
3. Maintainers will review within 1â€“2 business days. Expect feedback on tests, docs, or architecture alignment.
4. Resolve comments via follow-up commits. Once approved, squash-merge unless otherwise requested.

## 9. Working with AI Coding Assistants

- Reference this guide in prompts so generated changes respect conventions.
- Ensure AI-generated code includes TypeScript types and error handling consistent with existing patterns.
- Run formatting/linting after AI changes to avoid style drift.

## 10. Getting Help

- Open a GitHub Discussion or issue for architecture questions.
- Tag maintainers in PRs for urgent reviews (use sparingly).
- Share logs, reproduction steps, and environment info when reporting bugs (see [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)).

Thanks for contributing! Keeping docs, tests, and code aligned ensures fast onboarding for both humans and AI collaborators.
